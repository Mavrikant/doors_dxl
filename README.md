# DOORS DXL

The Rational® DOORS® eXtension Language (DXL) is an easy-to-learn scripting language that you can use to control and extend Rational DOORS functions.

    - Automate routine or complex tasks, such as calculating attribute values.
    - Respond to events by triggering custom programs.
    - Add your own options to Rational DOORS menus.

DXL syntax is like C and C++.
